================

This repository contains some helpful auxilliary files related to the [SALAMI project](http://ddmal.music.mcgill.ca/research/salami).

Contents include:

* A Ruby script that parses the annotations and generates separate lowercase, uppercase and function labels from each annotation: *get_sections_sept_2012.rb*
* A Ruby script that runs the above command on all the SALAMI annotations: *parse_annotations_shell.rb*
* A Matlab function to load parsed annotations: *annotation_getfile.m*
* A Python script that downloads mp3s of all the publically available music annotated by SALAMI (i.e., all the music taken from the Internet Archive): *SALAMI_download.py*

All files (unless otherwise specifiedâ€”e.g., see *SALAMI_download.py*) are released under the MIT License, outlined below.
